# Jodel AMA Viewer

This is a viewer for the shared [Jodel](https://jodel.com/) posts.

I wrote this to make it easier to view the questions to answers in [#JodelWahl](https://jodel.com/wahl/) jodels.

## Usage

1. Get a sharable link to a jodel. E.g. `https://share.jodel.com/post?postId=59aea982039e85001026c0d8&ojFilter=false`
2. Replace `https://share.jodel.com/post` with `https://ocjojo.github.io/jodel-ama-viewer/`
3. The best way to view a AMA is to click on "OJ" to filter the jodels of OJ.  
Then click on the references @{User} to see the posts of User together with the answer of OJ.
